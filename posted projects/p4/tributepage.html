      <h2>Leading Disruptions Accross Industries</h2>
      <p>Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. He is right now disrupting atleast 8 industries by way of his companies.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>A brief summary industry disruptions lead by him:
    <ul>
      <li>Automotive: Musk has propelled Tesla to become the most highly-valued carmaker in the world. Tesla is currently the leader in electric car makers</li>
      <li>Aerospace: SpaceX a aerospace company has significantly recuded the cost of space rockets and spce trips. Musk plans to build a “freeway” to Mars by reducing the cost of flying a spaceship to a fraction of what it is today, and to harness rocket technology for earth travel as well.</li>
      <li>Telecommunications: SpaceX is in process of developing a network of satelites called Starlink to make internet availaible, realiable and afordable over whole earth.</li>
      <li>Energy: According to a utilities lobbying group, Musk’s efforts with Tesla and SolarCity could “lay waste to US power utilities and burn the utility business model.”</li>
      <li>Transportation: We analyze the Hyperloop, Musk’s proposed “fifth mode of transportation” that’s a “cross between a Concorde and an air hockey table,” and the progress that’s been made.</li>
      <li>Infrastructure/Tunneling: We look at how Musk’s business, called The Boring Company, is trying to cut costs in the notoriously expensive tunneling industry, where a mile of tunnel can cost $1B to dig and each additional inch in diameter costs millions more.</li>
      <li>AI: We investigate why Musk, who is certain that the race for AI superiority will be the “most likely cause” of WWIII, is investing so much into building better AI.</li>
      <li>Healthcare: We dig into the high-bandwidth, minimally invasive brain machine interfaces that Neuralink is developing to create futuristic humans.</li>
    </ul>
